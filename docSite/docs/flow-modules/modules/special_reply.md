# Special Reply

- Can be added repeatedly (to prevent messy lines in complex arrangements and make it more visually appealing)
- Can be manually inputted
- Can be externally inputted
- Will output results to the client

The special reply module is usually used for replying to specific states. Of course, you can also implement some fancy operations like in Figure 2. The triggering logic is very simple. One way is to write the reply content and trigger it through a trigger. Another way is to not write the reply content and directly trigger it through external input, and reply with the inputted content.
